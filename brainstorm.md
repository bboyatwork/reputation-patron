Reproduceable research. Open sicence. NFT to liberate content, but solidifies ownership and attribution. Views equal reputation which has value as you proivde value by allowing content to be freely and publically available.

Can lead to direct grants and publicly funded scholarships or stduent debt clearance. You're investing in person and maybe theiri degree is tied to your investment in them. and you earn (reputation) based on their contribution to the world, not income. Again, reputation is vaaluable and most useful for local community. Not just sport stars would be funded this way, but scholarly stars and creatives.

'Condition on investment' ... if degreee is not completed your investment is returned or can be transfered. Could invest in a whole class/cohort ... so not depended on one person. 

Degree as NFT.

News For a Time. NFT as an opinion piece, or an analysis, or report, or first hand account even a quote that can be included in an article or video production and have the attribution linked ot trude identity.

This idea allows truth, but also gives choice of anonymity or ability to include weight of reputation that is lent to the outlet using the source.

What needs to be built is something that can link these attributes to their owners like ENS, but across multiple chains.
